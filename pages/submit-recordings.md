Any meetup can submit a recording or other audio file. Just submit a pull request to the Github repo. 

1.  Go to the WTD Podcast Github repository. 
2.  Create a new post in the `_posts` folder. 
3.  Copy the frontmatter tags from another post. 
4.  Customize the tags with your own values.
5.  Submit the pull request.


You can also reach out to us on the [WTD Slack channel](https://writethedocs.slack.com/messages/podcast).
